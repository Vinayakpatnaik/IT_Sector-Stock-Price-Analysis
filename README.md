### Introduction to NIFTY50

The IT Sector Analysis of Nifty50 stocks is a project related to exploratory data analysis(EDA) and data visualisation with data collected from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) India. We looked at real-time financial data from the stock market. We have used python libraries such as pandas,numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. to get stock information, visualise different aspects of it, and finally work on a few ways of analysing the stock, based on its previous performance history.
